Hi there,

   I am an active bachelor's student currently working on some Ideas to develop solutions for real world problems.
   Seriously exploring a lot of latest emerged technologies in software development and relevant AI advancements at the moment!
   Looking forward to my contribution to the open source software out there which will eventually make a profound Impact on respective organisations. 
   Take a look at my repositories that manifest the development I've done along the curve :)
