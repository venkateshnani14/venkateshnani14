Hi there,

   I am an active bachelor's student currently working on some Ideas to develop solutions for real world problems.
   Exploring a lot of latest emerging technologies in the realm of software and AI advancements at the moment!
   Looking forward to my contribution to the open source community out there... 
   Take a look at my repositories that manifest the development I've done along the curve :)
